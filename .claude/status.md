## Known Bugs

### Date Input Calendar Widget - Cursor Not Showing (Firefox)
- **Severity**: Low (UI/UX polish)
- **Description**: Date input field calendar widget does not show pointer cursor on hover in Firefox
- **Browser Support**: Confirmed broken in Firefox; behavior unknown in Safari and other browsers
- **Attempted Fixes**:
  - Added global CSS rules for `input[type="date"]` with `cursor: pointer`
  - Added WebKit-specific pseudo-element styling for `::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator`
  - Added `cursor: pointer` to Button component base classes
  - Implemented `showPicker()` on click (working correctly)
- **Impact**: Calendar widget opens correctly on click, but visual cursor feedback is missing
- **Next Steps**: May require browser-specific CSS or accept as browser limitation
